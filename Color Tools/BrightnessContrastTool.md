# Using the Brightness Contrast Tool

*Written by Robert Gordon*

## Brightness and Contrast 
Brightness changes the overall brightness of an image, while contrast is akin to changing the depth or color dynamic of an image. The default value for both is 0.

## Opening the Tool 

To locate and use the tool, select the color option at the top of the screen as shown below.

## Using the Tool 

### Before You Start 

#### Reset
If there is a change that you have made and you are unsatisfied with it, there are steps to undo a change. If a change has been saved, CTL+Z is your method of undo in GIMP. Otherwise, consider the following. 

Note the Reset Button on the tool.

Using this button will allow you to undo the current changes to brightness and contrast, setting both to their default value of 0. This is useful for experimenting with different values without committing the change to your image. 

#### Save

To save your changes made with the brightness tool, click the OK button. This will save your changes and commit them to your photo.

### Brightness 

To change the brightness of an image, open the tool and use the Brightness bar. It can be used like a slider, incremented and decremented with the arrow buttons, or a value can be typed in by clicking the numbers in the brightness bar and entering the desired number.

The following image is a screenshot of a user's desktop while enjoying a game. We will use this as an example of editing Brightness. (Note, the screenshot has multiple windows open on it and usernames have been censored with black bars).

And after brightness has been increased:

### Contrast

To change the contrast of an image, open the tool and use the Contrast bar. Contrast changes the depth of an image, the lower the value the more everything melds into one, and the higher the more prominent the top color will be.
