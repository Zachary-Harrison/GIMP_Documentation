# GIMP Color Tools

This guide will introduce you to the various color tools available in GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), a free and open-source image editing software.

## Color Tools Overview

GIMP provides a variety of color tools to help you manipulate and adjust the colors in your images. These tools include:

- [**Hue-Saturation Tool**](HueSaturationTool.md): Allows you to adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness of your image. You can adjust these settings for the entire image or for specific color ranges.
- [**Colorize Tool**](ColorizeTool.md): Allows you to apply a color tint to your image. You can adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness of the tint.
- [**Brightness-Contrast Tool**](BrightnessContrastTool.md): Allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of your image. You can adjust these settings for the entire image.
- [**Threshold Tool**](ThresholdTool.md): Allows you to convert your image to black and white, with the threshold setting determining the point at which pixels are converted to black or white.
- [**Levels Tool**](LevelsTool.md): Allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of your image. You can adjust the levels of the shadows, midtones, and highlights separately.
