Welcome to our documentation for the free, open-source tool known as GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)! 

This project aims to provide comprehensive, user-friendly documentation for GIMP. Our goal is to help users of all levels understand and effectively use GIMP's wide range of tools and features. 

> ${\color{red}\text{Important Note: This documentation is not exhaustive.}}$  
> *There might be more ways to use these tools that we describe, and there are more tools than we provide documentation for. Feel free to experiment with GIMP to see what it can do for you beyond what we've described.*


## Project Structure

The documentation is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different category of tools available in GIMP. These categories include:

- [Selection Tools](Selection%20Tools)
- [Paint Tools](Paint%20Tools)
- [Transform Tools](Transform%20Tools)
- [Color Tools](Color%20Tools)
- [Other Tools](Other)

Each section provides a brief overview of the tools in its category, along with step-by-step instructions on how to use them.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have tips, tricks, or additional information that you think would be helpful to other GIMP users, please feel free to contribute. You can do this by opening an issue or submitting a pull request, and we will try to respond as quickly as possible.
