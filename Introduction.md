# Introduction to GIMP Documentation Project
*Written by Zachary Harrison*

## Audience

Our primary audience for this documentation are beginners and intermediate users of GIMP who are looking to understand and utilize the various tools available in the software. This audience is appropriate as they are the ones who would benefit the most from detailed, step-by-step instructions and explanations of the software's features. To cater to this audience, we have focused on clear, concise language and included plenty of examples and screenshots.

## Content

In putting together this documentation, we conducted extensive research on GIMP's official documentation, user forums, and tutorials. We also used the software extensively to understand its features and functionalities. The content is meant to facilitate GIMP's usage and encourage users to explore and experiment with GIMP's tools beyond our descriptions. We included information on how to use each tool, tips for effective usage, and troubleshooting advice. We chose to include this information to provide a comprehensive guide for users to refer to when using GIMP.

## Appearance

We chose a markdown format for our documents for its simplicity and versatility. Markdown is easy to write and read, and it can be converted to many output formats like HTML and PDF. We also used plenty of headings and subheadings to make the document easy to navigate. Code blocks and images were used to illustrate points and provide visual aid.

In addition, we chose to host our documentation on GitHub due to its wide accessibility and built-in rendering capabilities. GitHub allows for easy public access, making our documentation readily available to anyone interested in learning about GIMP's tools. This is particularly beneficial for open-source projects where community contributions are encouraged.

Furthermore, GitHub handles all the rendering needed for our project. Markdown files are automatically rendered to HTML on GitHub, allowing users to view the documentation directly in their web browser without needing to download or convert the files themselves. This greatly simplifies the viewing process and ensures that our documentation is accessible to users of all technical levels.

By leveraging the features of markdown and GitHub, we aim to provide a user-friendly and accessible documentation for GIMP users.

## Experience

In retrospect, we would probably include more visual aids like screenshots and diagrams in the next iteration to make the instructions even clearer. The most enjoyable part was experimenting with GIMP's tools and discovering new features. The most difficult part was ensuring that the instructions were clear and easy to understand, as GIMP is a complex software with many features. However, we believe that this documentation will be a valuable resource for GIMP users.
